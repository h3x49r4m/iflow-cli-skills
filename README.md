# Nova

A comprehensive skills-based development system for the iFlow CLI, featuring 12 role-based skills, 3 pipeline orchestrators, and advanced git workflow automation.

## Overview

iFlow CLI Skills transforms software development into a collaborative, role-based workflow where specialized AI agents work together through orchestrated pipelines. The system uses a shared state directory for seamless collaboration, supports version management, and includes gate-based workflow orchestration with reversible approvals.

## Features

### 🎭 Role-Based Skills
12 specialized development roles, each with specific responsibilities and state contracts:
- **Client** - Requirements provider and stakeholder
- **Product Manager** - Feature planning and prioritization
- **Project Manager** - Sprint planning and resource allocation
- **UI/UX Designer** - Design creation and user experience
- **Tech Lead** - Architecture design and technical strategy
- **Software Engineer** - Full-stack implementation
- **Testing Engineer** - Test automation and frameworks
- **QA Engineer** - Quality validation and manual testing
- **DevOps Engineer** - CI/CD and infrastructure
- **Security Engineer** - Security validation and scanning
- **Documentation Specialist** - Documentation creation

### 🚀 Pipeline Orchestrators
3 automated pipelines that coordinate multiple roles:
- **New Project Pipeline** - Complete development lifecycle from scratch
- **New Feature Pipeline** - Streamlined feature development for existing projects
- **Bug Fix Pipeline** - Rapid bug fixing workflow

### 🔄 Git Workflow Automation
- **git-flow** - Gate-based workflow orchestration with role-based branching, review/approval gates, phase tracking, and reversible approvals
- **git-manage** - Standardized git operations with safety checks, TDD enforcement, and conventional commits

### 📦 Version Management
Comprehensive version management infrastructure with:
- Semantic versioning for all skills
- Capability declarations per version
- Breaking change tracking
- Dependency resolution
- Compatibility checking between skills and pipelines

### 📊 Shared State System
Centralized state directory with 14 state documents:
- `project-spec.md` - Project requirements and features
- `design-spec.md` - UI/UX designs and prototypes
- `architecture-spec.md` - System architecture and tech stack
- `implementation-plan.md` - Task breakdown and timeline
- `implementation.md` - Full-stack implementation details
- `test-plan.md` - Test strategy and test cases
- `test-results.md` - Test execution results
- `quality-report.md` - Quality validation and bug reports
- `security-report.md` - Security analysis and vulnerabilities
- `deployment-status.md` - Deployment history and environment status
- `api-docs.md` - API documentation and schemas
- `user-guide.md` - User documentation and tutorials
- `changelog.md` - Change history and version notes
- `pipeline-status.md` - Pipeline progress and stage status

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.14+
- iFlow CLI installed and configured
- Git installed and configured

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:h3x49r4m/nova.git
cd nova
```

2. Verify skill structure:
```bash
ls .iflow/skills/
```

3. Check skill status:
```bash
python3 .iflow/skills/skill_cli.py list
```

## Usage

### Activating Skills

#### Single Role Activation
Activate a specific role to work independently:

```bash
# Activate as Client
iflow skill client

# Activate as Tech Lead
iflow skill tech-lead

# Activate as Software Engineer
iflow skill software-engineer
```

**Workflow:**
1. Role reads `.shared-state/` directory
2. Understands context and previous work
3. Performs its specialized tasks
4. Updates specific documents in `.shared-state/`
5. Updates `pipeline-status.md` with completion status

#### Pipeline Execution
Activate a pipeline to orchestrate multiple roles:

```bash
# New project pipeline (full development lifecycle)
iflow skill team-pipeline-new-project

# New feature pipeline (add features to existing project)
iflow skill team-pipeline-new-feature

# Bug fix pipeline (rapid bug fixing)
iflow skill team-pipeline-fix-bug
```

**Workflow:**
1. Orchestrator reads `config.json` for role sequence
2. Executes roles in defined sequence
3. Each role reads state, performs work, updates state
4. Orchestrator tracks progress via `pipeline-status.md`
5. Pipeline completes when all roles finish

### Git Workflow

#### Git-Flow Workflow

**Start a new feature workflow:**
```bash
/git-flow start "User Authentication"
```

**Commit changes:**
```bash
/git-flow commit src/auth.py
```

**Review pending branches:**
```bash
/git-flow review
```

**Approve a branch:**
```bash
/git-flow approve tech-lead/auth-architecture
```

**Reject a branch:**
```bash
/git-flow reject software-engineer/auth-api --reason "Tests failing"
```

**View workflow status:**
```bash
/git-flow status
```

**Advance to next phase:**
```bash
/git-flow phase-next
```

#### Git-Manage Workflow

**Check status with test results:**
```bash
/git-manage status
```

**Stage and commit changes:**
```bash
/git-manage add src/auth.py
/git-manage commit feat: implement user authentication
```

**View changes:**
```bash
/git-manage diff
```

**Undo last commit:**
```bash
/git-manage undo soft
```

**Push to remote:**
```bash
/git-manage push origin feat/authentication
```

### Version Management

**List all skills:**
```bash
python3 .iflow/skills/skill_cli.py list
```

**Check skill version:**
```bash
python3 .iflow/skills/skill_cli.py info software-engineer
```

**Check compatibility:**
```bash
python3 .iflow/skills/skill_cli.py check team-pipeline-new-feature
```

## Workflows

### New Project Workflow

```
Client → Product Manager → Project Manager → UI/UX Designer → Tech Lead → 
Software Engineer → Testing Engineer → QA Engineer → DevOps Engineer → 
Security Engineer → Documentation Specialist
```

**Duration:** Complete development lifecycle

### New Feature Workflow

```
Client (optional) → Product Manager → Project Manager → UI/UX Designer → 
Tech Lead → Software Engineer → Testing Engineer → QA Engineer → 
DevOps Engineer (if needed) → Security Engineer → Documentation Specialist
```

**Duration:** Feature development cycle

### Bug Fix Workflow

```
Client (optional) → Tech Lead → Software Engineer → Testing Engineer → 
QA Engineer → DevOps Engineer (if critical hotfix) → Documentation Specialist (if needed)
```

**Duration:** Rapid bug fix cycle

## State-First Approach

Every role follows this pattern:

1. **READ STATE** - Read relevant documents from `.shared-state/`
2. **ANALYZE CONTEXT** - Understand previous work, requirements, constraints
3. **PERFORM WORK** - Execute role-specific tasks
4. **UPDATE STATE** - Write updated documents to `.shared-state/`
5. **REPORT STATUS** - Update `pipeline-status.md`

### State Contracts

Each role's `SKILL.md` defines:
- **READ contracts** - What documents to read before starting
- **WRITE contracts** - What documents to update after completing
- **Validation rules** - Rules for state consistency

## Configuration

### Skill Configuration

Each skill can be configured via `config.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "capabilities": ["capability1", "capability2"],
  "compatible_pipelines": ["*"],
  "dependencies": {}
}
```

### Git-Flow Configuration

Edit `.iflow/skills/git-flow/config.json`:

```json
{
  "workflow": {
    "auto_detect_role": true,
    "auto_create_branch": true,
    "auto_phase_transition": true,
    "require_all_phases": false,
    "allow_parallel_phases": false
  },
  "merge": {
    "strategy": "rebase-merge",
    "delete_branch_after_merge": true,
    "require_dependencies_merged": true
  },
  "unapproval": {
    "allow_unapprove_after_merge": true,
    "default_action": "cascade-revert",
    "require_cascade_confirmation": true
  }
}
```

### Git-Manage Configuration

Edit `.iflow/skills/git-manage/config.json`:

```json
{
  "preCommit": {
    "testCommand": "pytest tests/ -v --cov",
    "coverageThreshold": {
      "lines": 90,
      "branches": 80
    },
    "runTddCheck": true
  }
}
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
python3 .iflow/skills/tests/run_tests.py
```

Run specific tests:

```bash
python3 -m pytest .iflow/skills/tests/test_skill_manager.py -v
```
