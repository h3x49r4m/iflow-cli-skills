# Design Creation Workflow

## Objective
Create wireframes, prototypes, and design system.

## Steps

1. **Analyze Requirements**
   - Read `project-spec.md`
   - Understand user stories and use cases
   - Identify user personas and scenarios

2. **Create Wireframes**
   - Design low-fidelity wireframes for each screen
   - Map user flows and navigation paths
   - Focus on layout and functionality

3. **Develop Prototypes**
   - Create interactive prototypes
   - Test and validate user flows
   - Iterate based on feedback

4. **Define Design System**
   - Establish color palette
   - Define typography scale
   - Create component library (buttons, forms, cards, etc.)
   - Document spacing and layout rules

5. **Ensure Accessibility**
   - Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines
   - Ensure proper color contrast
   - Design for keyboard navigation
   - Include ARIA labels where needed

6. **Responsive Design**
   - Design for multiple breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Ensure layouts adapt gracefully
   - Test on different screen sizes

7. **Document Everything**
   - Update `design-spec.md` with all design artifacts
   - Include wireframes, prototypes, and design system

## Output
- Updated `design-spec.md` with complete design artifacts
- Commit changes using git-manage
- Updated `pipeline-status.md` with completion status
