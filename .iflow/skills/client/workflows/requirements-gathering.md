   - Capture workflow requirements

3. **Gather Non-Functional Requirements**
   - Performance requirements (response time, throughput)
   - Security requirements (authentication, data protection)
   - Scalability requirements (expected load, growth)
   - Availability requirements (uptime SLA)

4. **Define Acceptance Criteria**
