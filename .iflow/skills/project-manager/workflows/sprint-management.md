# Sprint Management Workflow

## Objective
Plan sprints, allocate resources, and manage project timeline.

## Steps

1. **Analyze Features**
   - Read `project-spec.md`
   - Review prioritized features and user stories
   - Understand feature complexity and dependencies

2. **Break Down Features into Tasks**
   - Decompose each user story into actionable tasks
   - Estimate effort for each task (story points or hours)
   - Identify dependencies between tasks

3. **Create Sprint Backlog**
   - Group tasks into sprints based on velocity and timeline
   - Ensure sprint goals are achievable
   - Balance workload across team members

4. **Allocate Resources**
   - Assign tasks to team members based on skills and capacity
   - Consider team availability and other commitments
   - Balance workload and prevent bottlenecks

5. **Define Milestones**
   - Set clear milestones for each sprint
   - Define deliverables for each milestone
   - Establish success criteria

6. **Risk Management**
   - Identify potential risks (technical, resource, timeline)
   - Assess risk impact and probability
   - Create mitigation strategies

7. **Document Everything**
   - Update `implementation-plan.md` with sprint details
   - Include task breakdown, timeline, and resource allocation

## Output
- Updated `implementation-plan.md` with sprint details and resource allocation
- Updated `pipeline-status.md` with completion status
